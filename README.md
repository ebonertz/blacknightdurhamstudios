To deploy your `/src` directory to GitHub Pages, be sure to commit all of your changes and make a new branch called `gh-pages`. Once you are checked into the `gh-pages` branch, run the following command:

```
git subtree push --prefix src origin gh-pages
```

This will push the `src` folder up to GitHub on the `gh-pages` branch. After that, you should be able to open up `http://username.github.io/BootstrapPortfolioProject`, where `username` is your GitHub username.
